# basic-discord-bot
A very simple discord bot in progress to practice working with various libraries and environments in python. 
Eventually I hope to write a functioning music bot with commands personalized for a private server used by some of my friends and I.

Since I've been using JavaScript more frequently as of late, at some point before the Summer ends I'm going to
reimplement this bot using the discord.js module - might create a new repository for it as well.

Take care!
